# Transaction Categorizer UI â€” Requirements Document

## 1. Overview  
The Transaction Categorizer UI is designed to assist users in categorizing financial transactions efficiently. The system will automatically suggest categories based on transaction data, allow users to review and override suggestions, and provide intuitive navigation and interaction features to streamline categorization workflows.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Transaction Display  
- Transactions will be presented as a list.  
- Current transaction to categorize will be visually highlighted.  
- Large transaction lists must support pagination to maintain performance and usability.

### 2.2 Categorization Suggestions  
- Each transaction may come with a default category suggestion derived from transaction data.  
- The UI will display multiple candidate categories based on transaction attributes (e.g., merchant name, amount).  
- Users can select any suggested category or override the suggestion with a custom category.

### 2.3 User Interaction and Navigation  
- Users can accept the default or selected category quickly, ideally by pressing the Return/Enter key.  
- Arrow keys will navigate through the list of category suggestions.  
- Users can navigate forward and backward through the transaction list seamlessly.  
- Users can revisit and edit previous categorization decisions at any time before saving.

### 2.4 Commitment and Status Indication  
- Transactions categorized by the user (including acceptance of defaults) are marked as committed.  
- Committed transactions will be visually distinguished, for example, by a green checkmark icon.  
- The UI will clearly indicate which transactions are pending categorization and which are committed.

### 2.5 Saving and Persistence  
- A "Save" button will allow users to persist all committed categorizations to the backend or local storage.  
- Optionally, provide an auto-save feature or prompt to save periodically.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance  
- The UI must remain responsive when handling large transaction datasets.  
- Pagination or virtual scrolling should be used to optimize rendering performance.

### 3.2 Usability  
- Minimize the number of required user interactions to categorize transactions.  
- Keyboard shortcuts (Return, arrow keys) must be implemented for efficiency.  
- Visual feedback must be clear and intuitive.

### 3.3 Accessibility  
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigability, screen reader support).

## 4. User Roles and Permissions  
- Define if there are different user roles (e.g., admin, standard user) and what actions each role can perform.  
- Specify whether all users can override categories or if this is restricted.

---

## 5. Error Handling and Validation  
- Handle scenarios where no category suggestion is available gracefully.  
- Warn users if they try to save without committing any transactions.  
- Validate user inputs when entering custom categories.

---

## 6. Audit and History  
- Maintain a log or history of categorization changes per transaction.  
- Allow users to view previous categorizations or revert changes if needed.

---

## 7. Integration and Data Sources  
- Describe how transaction data is sourced and updated in the UI.  
- Define how categorization data syncs with backend systems or databases.

---

## 8. Security Considerations  
- Ensure that transaction data and user actions are securely handled and stored.  
- Implement authentication and authorization if applicable.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements (Optional)  
- Machine learning improvements for category suggestions over time based on user behavior.  
- Bulk categorization for similar transactions.  
- Export categorized transactions to external formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
